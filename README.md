# hello-world
Hello. I am brand new to programming. I am using GitHub for the first time. I hope someday to learn to program applications for both the web and operating systems. Through these applications, I hope to become supreme ruler of the Galaxy.

Only the Galaxy for now. The Universe as a whole just seems to be too much trouble.
